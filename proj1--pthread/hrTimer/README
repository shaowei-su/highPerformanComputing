===================================
o Sun machines (e.g. heart) and IBM PowerPC machines (e.g. discovery)
  (Thanks to Bijun He)

  o For regular uses, just call gethrtime() on Sun machine and
    get_real_time() on PowerPC.  Both are in nano-second precision but
    the function call itself is quite costly: 200ns for gethrtime()
    and 100ns for get_real_time().
  
  o For high resolution timing, see file hw_timers.h with lots of comments.

o Linux machines 
  (Thanks to Kai Shen)

  See file hrtimer_x86.c and hrtimer_x86.h. They provides function
  gethrtime_x86() for high resolution timing.

o Alpha machines

  See file hrtimer_alpha.c and hrtimer_alpha.h. They provides function
  gethrtime_alpha() for high resolution timing. Note, this is for
  short period high resolution timing. The timer will reset to 0 after
  7.17023 seconds. If you want to timing more, you may want to do some
  accumulating work.
